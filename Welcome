title: SlaveryOFF
description: According to the Global Slavery Index, 40 million people are still enslaved today, 25 millions of them being in forced labor.

While this remains an alarming trend, evidence shows that consumers worldwide are unconsciously buying products at risk of being made under forced labor conditions. 

We propose SlaveryOFF, an application that will help us, the  consumers, to make informed purchases, by assessing the risk  of forced labor in supply chains.

We are hoping to use your input in designing this app and make it as useful and easy to use as possible. 

Thank you very much in advance, 

Adriana and Andres
